		I recently started making YouTube videos! I love filming my daily life, my outings with friends and my travels. My goal is to share joy and hapiness!🎥

	  <h2>Why did I start making videos ? 🎥</h2>
	   <p>
	  	During the first lockdown, like everyone else, I was locked in. I had finished school as I was going to be on work experience and the days were going to be very long. During the first lockdown, like everyone else, I was locked in. I had finished school as I was going to be on work experience and the days were going to be very long. I had always wanted to film and learn video editing but I had always lacked the time.

	   <p>
		So during the first lockdown, I took my chance! At first I just sent my videos to my friends and then they encouraged me to create a YouTube channel and that's how I started making videos on YouTube every Sunday.

	  <h2>From a hobby to a real passion 💻</h2>
	   <p>
	   	At the beginning, I filmed a bit of everything and nothing, my editing was not necessarily very well done and my videos were not organised. Little by little, I decided to put into practice what I had learned during my training. I am currently creating a graphic charter and a schedule for my social networks. I am very involved in this project which is very close to my heart!

	  <h2>What are the next steps?⏳</h2>
	   <p>
	   	At the end of my master's degree, I would like to take some time to either travel and make videos of my travels, or continue my studies abroad so that I can show in videos what it's like to study abroad!
	   </p>
	   <p>
	   	And who knows...maybe one day I'll be able to make a living from my YouTube channel and put a smile on people's faces through my videos!
